	The electronics used in this project are as following:
 -	Arduino Nano Every(this can be substitued for another small arduino compatible microcontroller)
 -	5v Neopixel LED strip
 -	Battery(Rechargable Lipo or AAA batteries
 -	General Electronics wire(not braided)

	3d printed Parts(all of the parts are separated bodies in the 3mf file:
 -	Print the diffusion plate in a clear filament, PETG is reccomended
 -	Print the other two parts in a opaque filament, PLA was used to allow the m3 heat set inserts to set well, PETG will work fine though
